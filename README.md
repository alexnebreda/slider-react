# Slider from 0 by React with Styled components

This is a component created by Reacth without libraries, just with React Hooks: useRef, useEffect and useCallback.
Also is used CSS Styled Components.

I implemented this carousel, on the B2B Home page of Mediamarkt Spain:
https://specials.mediamarkt.es/empresas
